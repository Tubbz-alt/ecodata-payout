# Ecodata Payout Contract

This repo contains an example CosmWasm smart contract for use in developing oracles for Phase 5 of Regen Network's Kontraua Test Net. More information on the Phase 5 challenge "Payout Contract for ecological credits" can be found [here](https://github.com/regen-network/testnets/blob/master/kontraua/challenges/phase-5/README.md).

## Build & Test

Run the following to build the contract from source, and run both unit & integration tests. This will test both the native rust code (unit tests), as well as the functionality of the compiled wasm code.

```rust
cargo build
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo test
```

## Uploading to Kontraua

For uploading the code to the Kontraua testnet, you can follow the instructions from the Phase 2 challenge [here](https://github.com/regen-network/testnets/blob/master/kontraua/challenges/phase-2/instructions.md#step---1--upload-your-contract-optional).
